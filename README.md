aaPkgManager

This is really more of a placeholder than real code right now.  The working concept is to create a DLL that makes working with aapkg files easier.  Conceptually an aapkg is just a CAB inside a CAB with an XML manifest and text files for the actual code.  It is quite simple to manipulate the contents externally so you can better control what gets imported.
